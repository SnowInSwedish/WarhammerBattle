    <h1>Tyranid Crusade Rules</h1>
    <p>In this section you’ll find additional rules for playing Crusade battles that are bespoke to TYRANIDS units. You can find out more about Crusade armies in the main Crusade rules.</p>

    <h2>This section contains the following rules:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Devouring Worlds:</strong> Strengthen your force as your foes fall.</li>
        <li><strong>Agendas:</strong> Unique goals and methods of waging war.</li>
        <li><strong>Requisitions:</strong> Special requisitions for Tyranid armies.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle Traits:</strong> Gain new traits as your force grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle Scars:</strong> Long-lasting effects representing Tyranid nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Crusade Relics:</strong> Powerful relics for Tyranid characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Crusade Badges:</strong> Set and achieve goals for your Crusade force.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Devouring Worlds</h2>
    <p>Your Crusade force can only work on devouring one world at a time. It will move through three stages: Invasion, Predation, and finally Consumption. Each stage devours more of the world’s biomass. Generate a new world if your force has no active world to devour.</p>

    <h3>Generating a World</h3>
    <p>To generate a world, roll a D6 and consult the following table:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>World Type</th>
                <th>D6 Roll</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Industrial World</td>
                <td>1-2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rural World</td>
                <td>3-4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hive World</td>
                <td>5-6</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Biomass and Battles Played</h3>
    <p>Use the following tables to generate the Biomass and Battles Played points needed for each stage of destruction:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Stage</th>
                <th>Biomass</th>
                <th>Battles Played</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Invasion</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>2D3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Predation</td>
                <td>+D3</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Consumption</td>
                <td>+3</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Completing a Devouring Stage</h3>
    <p>To complete a stage and move on, your force must acquire the necessary Biomass and Battles Played points. Each time you win or lose a battle, you gain or lose Biomass points. Biomass points can also be earned through Agendas.</p>

    <!-- New content starts here -->
    <h2>Stages of Devouring</h2>

    <div class="stage">
        <h3>Stage 1: Invasion</h3>
        <h4>Vanguard Adaptation (1RP)</h4>
        <p>In the first stages of a Tyranid invasion, swift and adaptable broods of bioforms assess and counteract the defences of the prey. Some organisms may have infiltrated the world and now wreak havoc, while others descend from the skies as harbingers of greater threats.</p>
        <p><strong>Requisition:</strong> Purchase this Requisition before a battle once per world. Select two <strong>VANGUARD INVADER</strong> units (excluding CHARACTERS and MONSTERS) from your Order of Battle. For the next battle, swap their Battle Traits and adjust their Crusade point totals. After the battle, revert the changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Battle Experience:</strong> Units with any of the following keywords gain 1 additional XP if wholly within your opponent’s deployment zone at the end of the battle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ENDLESS MULTITUDE</li>
            <li>VANGUARD INVADER</li>
            <li>WARLORD</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="stage">
        <h3>Stage 2: Predation</h3>
        <h4>Infestation (1RP)</h4>
        <p>As the prey world is overrun with Tyranid organisms, swarms of bioforms prowl all environments, attacking defenders from unexpected locations. No position is truly safe from the Tyranid advance.</p>
        <p><strong>Requisition:</strong> Purchase this Requisition before a battle once per devoured world. Select one <strong>ENDLESS MULTITUDE</strong> unit from your Order of Battle. For the next battle, this unit gains the <strong>Infiltrators</strong> ability.</p>
        <p><strong>Battle Experience:</strong> Units with any of the following keywords gain 1 additional XP if they control an objective marker in No Man’s Land at the end of the battle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BIOVORES</li>
            <li>EXOCRINE</li>
            <li>HARUSPEX</li>
            <li>HIVE GUARD</li>
            <li>HIVE TYRANT</li>
            <li>PYROVORES</li>
            <li>TYRANNOFEX</li>
            <li>TYRANT GUARD</li>
            <li>WARLORD</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="stage">
        <h3>Stage 3: Consumption</h3>
        <h4>Guard and Consume (1RP)</h4>
        <p>As the Tyranid forces begin to devour the world, they create grotesque bio-structures vital to the final consumption process. Tyranid organisms tasked with protecting these structures become more aggressive, as eater-beasts ferry biomass back to the hive ships.</p>
        <p><strong>Requisition:</strong> Purchase this Requisition after a battle once per devoured world. Choose a <strong>CHARACTER</strong> or <strong>MONSTER</strong> unit that survived the battle; that unit gains 5XP.</p>
        <p><strong>Battle Experience:</strong> Units with any of the following keywords gain 1 additional XP if they were not destroyed by the end of the battle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BIOVORES</li>
            <li>EXOCRINE</li>
            <li>HARUSPEX</li>
            <li>HIVE GUARD</li>
            <li>HIVE TYRANT</li>
            <li>PYROVORES</li>
            <li>TYRANNOFEX</li>
            <li>TYRANT GUARD</li>
            <li>WARLORD</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- New content ends here -->

    <h2>Agendas</h2>
    <p>Tyranid armies can achieve unique Agendas representing their goals and methods of war.</p>

    <h2>Requisitions</h2>
    <p>Tyranid armies have access to bespoke Requisitions. For example:</p>
    <h3>Vanguard Adaptation (1RP)</h3>
    <p>Purchase before a battle. Select two VANGUARD INVADER units. You can swap their Battle Traits for one battle.</p>

    <h2>Battle Traits</h2>
    <p>TYRANIDS units in your Crusade force can gain special Battle Traits as they gain experience.</p>

    <h2>Battle Scars</h2>
    <p>Themed to the unique nature of the TYRANIDS, these Battle Scars represent long-lasting effects units from your Crusade force may come to carry.</p>

    <h2>Crusade Relics</h2>
    <p>In addition to Crusade Relics in other publications, TYRANIDS CHARACTER models can claim one of the relics found here.</p>

    <h2>Crusade Badges</h2>
    <p>Here you will find three Crusade Badges representing goals you can set when campaigning with your force. Once one is achieved, you could set a new goal or start a new force.</p>

    <h2>Biogenesis</h2>
    <p>Once your force completes the Consumption stage of a world, you can spend Biomass points on upgrades:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Swarm Grows:</strong> Increase your Supply Limit by 100 points (2 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Rare Biomorphs:</strong> Reduce the cost of the Renowned Heroes Requisition by 1RP (4 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Organisms:</strong> Select a TYRANIDS unit to gain 5XP (5 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Adaptation:</strong> Use the Adapted Physiology Requisition once for 0RP (5 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Resources:</strong> Gain 1RP (6 Biomass points).</li>
    </ul>
