    <h1>Tyranid Crusade Rules</h1>
    <p>In this section you’ll find additional rules for playing Crusade battles that are bespoke to TYRANIDS units. You can find out more about Crusade armies in the main Crusade rules.</p>

    <h2>This section contains the following rules:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Devouring Worlds:</strong> Strengthen your force as your foes fall.</li>
        <li><strong>Agendas:</strong> Unique goals and methods of waging war.</li>
        <li><strong>Requisitions:</strong> Special requisitions for Tyranid armies.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle Traits:</strong> Gain new traits as your force grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle Scars:</strong> Long-lasting effects representing Tyranid nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Crusade Relics:</strong> Powerful relics for Tyranid characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Crusade Badges:</strong> Set and achieve goals for your Crusade force.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Devouring Worlds</h2>
    <p>Your Crusade force can only work on devouring one world at a time. It will move through three stages: Invasion, Predation, and finally Consumption. Each stage devours more of the world’s biomass. Generate a new world if your force has no active world to devour.</p>

    <h3>Generating a World</h3>
    <p>To generate a world, roll a D6 and consult the following table:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>World Type</th>
                <th>D6 Roll</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Industrial World</td>
                <td>1-2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rural World</td>
                <td>3-4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hive World</td>
                <td>5-6</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Biomass and Battles Played</h3>
    <p>Use the following tables to generate the Biomass and Battles Played points needed for each stage of destruction:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Stage</th>
                <th>Biomass</th>
                <th>Battles Played</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Invasion</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>2D3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Predation</td>
                <td>+D3</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Consumption</td>
                <td>+3</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Completing a Devouring Stage</h3>
    <p>To complete a stage and move on, your force must acquire the necessary Biomass and Battles Played points. Each time you win or lose a battle, you gain or lose Biomass points. Biomass points can also be earned through Agendas.</p>

    <h2>Agendas</h2>
    <p>Tyranid armies can achieve unique Agendas representing their goals and methods of war.</p>

    <h2>Requisitions</h2>
    <p>Tyranid armies have access to bespoke Requisitions. For example:</p>
    <h3>Vanguard Adaptation (1RP)</h3>
    <p>Purchase before a battle. Select two VANGUARD INVADER units. You can swap their Battle Traits for one battle.</p>

    <h2>Battle Traits</h2>
    <p>TYRANIDS units in your Crusade force can gain special Battle Traits as they gain experience.</p>

    <h2>Battle Scars</h2>
    <p>Themed to the unique nature of the TYRANIDS, these Battle Scars represent long-lasting effects units from your Crusade force may come to carry.</p>

    <h2>Crusade Relics</h2>
    <p>In addition to Crusade Relics in other publications, TYRANIDS CHARACTER models can claim one of the relics found here.</p>

    <h2>Crusade Badges</h2>
    <p>Here you will find three Crusade Badges representing goals you can set when campaigning with your force. Once one is achieved, you could set a new goal or start a new force.</p>

    <h2>Biogenesis</h2>
    <p>Once your force completes the Consumption stage of a world, you can spend Biomass points on upgrades:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Swarm Grows:</strong> Increase your Supply Limit by 100 points (2 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Rare Biomorphs:</strong> Reduce the cost of the Renowned Heroes Requisition by 1RP (4 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Organisms:</strong> Select a TYRANIDS unit to gain 5XP (5 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Adaptation:</strong> Use the Adapted Physiology Requisition once for 0RP (5 Biomass points).</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Resources:</strong> Gain 1RP (6 Biomass points).</li>
    </ul>
