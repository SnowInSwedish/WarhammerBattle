        <h1>General Crusade Rules</h1>
        <p>Crusade is a narrative campaign mode for Warhammer 40k, where your armies evolve over time as they gain experience, upgrades, and battle scars. This page provides an overview of the general rules for setting up a Crusade army and progressing through campaigns.</p>

        <h2>1. Building a Crusade Force</h2>
        <p>To start a Crusade campaign, you need to create a Crusade force. Each unit in your Crusade force starts with a certain number of <strong>Power Level</strong> or <strong>Points</strong> as specified in your army list. Your Crusade roster can grow over time as you gain <strong>Requisition Points (RP)</strong> to add more units.</p>

        <h3>Starting Supply Limit</h3>
        <p>Your Crusade force begins with a Supply Limit of 50 Power (or 1000 points). You can increase this limit as you progress through the campaign.</p>

        <h2>2. Requisition Points (RP)</h2>
        <p>Requisition Points are the currency of your Crusade campaign. You earn RP by winning battles, achieving goals, and other objectives. RP can be spent on various actions, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reinforcements:</strong> Add new units to your roster.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> Purchase upgrades or enhancements for your units.</li>
            <li><strong>Crusade Relics:</strong> Give your units special weapons or abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Rebuilding Units:</strong> Replace units that have taken significant damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Battle Experience</h2>
        <p>After each battle, units in your Crusade force gain <strong>Experience Points (XP)</strong> based on their performance. Once a unit earns enough XP, they can gain <strong>Battle Honours</strong>, which improve their abilities, such as increased weapon skill or additional abilities.</p>

        <h3>Battle Scars</h3>
        <p>If a unit suffers major casualties in battle, they may earn a <strong>Battle Scar</strong>, which negatively affects their performance in future battles. These represent the toll of war on your Crusade army.</p>

        <h2>4. Crusade Relics</h2>
        <p>As your Crusade army advances, your heroes can claim powerful <strong>Crusade Relics</strong>, granting them unique abilities. These relics can be earned through winning battles, completing special objectives, or spending RP.</p>

        <h2>5. Agendas</h2>
        <p>Each battle in a Crusade campaign includes specific <strong>Agendas</strong> that your army can pursue. Agendas allow you to achieve objectives that are aligned with your army’s goals. Successfully completing an Agenda rewards your units with XP, RP, or other bonuses.</p>

        <h2>6. Campaign Progression</h2>
        <p>As you play through a Crusade campaign, you can track your army’s progress in various ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Battle Tallies:</strong> Keep track of battles won and lost.</li>
            <li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Track specific goals or milestones reached during the campaign.</li>
            <li><strong>Worlds Conquered:</strong> For narrative campaigns, keep a record of the worlds or territories your army has conquered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Custom Crusade Rules</h2>
        <p>Depending on the narrative you wish to build, you can include custom rules or house rules in your Crusade campaign. This could include special missions, additional restrictions, or unique rewards for completing narrative objectives.</p>

        <p>Crusade campaigns are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing you to craft epic stories and immersive battles for your Warhammer 40k armies.</p>
