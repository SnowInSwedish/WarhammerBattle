        <h1>Adeptus Mechanicus Crusade Rules</h1>

        <p>Welcome, Magi of the Omnissiah! These rules are specifically tailored for playing Crusade battles with your Adeptus Mechanicus army. Forge your path to technological supremacy as you uncover ancient relics and dominate your enemies with the sacred knowledge of the Machine God.</p>

        <h2>The Search for Archeotech</h2>
        <p>Your Adeptus Mechanicus Crusade force can embark upon the search for ancient Archeotech. As you battle, you will uncover rare technological fragments, gathering them into powerful relics to be used by your Tech-Priests.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Each time you win a battle, roll 1D6. On a 5+, you acquire one Archeotech Part.</li>
            <li>Parts can either be <strong>Power Sources</strong> or other types determined by rolling 1D6.</li>
        </ul>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>D6 Roll</th>
                    <th>Archeotech Part</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>Weapon Part</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Force Field Part</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>Techno-Arcana Part</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Assembling Archeotech Treasures</h2>
        <p>Once you have collected a Power Source and another Archeotech Part, you can assemble them into a powerful Archeotech Treasure using the <strong>Assemble Archeotech</strong> Requisition.</p>

        <p>Tech-Priests equipped with Archeotech Treasures gain unique abilities and bonuses, ranging from potent weaponry to powerful force fields. Use these ancient relics to tip the scales of battle in your favor!</p>

        <h2>Crusade Agendas</h2>
        <p>Your Adeptus Mechanicus forces can pursue unique objectives beyond the standard agendas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collect Location Data:</strong> Search for Archeotech parts during battles, gathering vital information for future relic hunts.</li>
            <li><strong>Claim Legendary Archeotech:</strong> Once enough data is collected, scan battlefields for legendary Archeotech treasures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Requisitions</h2>
        <p>Use your Requisitions to enhance your forces and expedite the search for Archeotech treasures. Bespoke requisitions for Adeptus Mechanicus armies allow for the crafting of powerful relics, the assembly of new war gear, and more:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assemble Archeotech:</strong> Combine a Power Source with an Archeotech Part to craft an Archeotech Treasure.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Sermon of Deployment:</strong> Deploy legendary Archeotech in critical battles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Battle Traits</h2>
        <p>As your units gain experience, you can assign them special battle traits specific to the Adeptus Mechanicus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Overload:</strong> Gain a bonus to Leadership checks when within 6" of a friendly Tech-Priest.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyper-Cogitator:</strong> Re-roll one failed hit or wound roll per game.</li>
            <li><strong>Techno-Apprentice:</strong> Gain a free Requisition once per campaign, representing a tech-savvy apprentice's successful salvage of rare parts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Crusade Relics</h2>
        <p>In addition to general Crusade relics, Adeptus Mechanicus Characters can earn bespoke relics for their unrelenting service to the Omnissiah. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arc Annulus:</strong> A devastating ranged weapon with anti-vehicle properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Technodermis Armor:</strong> Grants enhanced save and wound characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Syntaxik Charger:</strong> A one-shot weapon that demoralizes enemies by scrambling their combat data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Crusade Badges</h2>
        <p>Mark your campaign progress with bespoke Adeptus Mechanicus badges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Master of Relics:</strong> Earn this badge by successfully assembling and using 5 Archeotech Treasures.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine God's Vengeance:</strong> Defeat a Warlord or Legendary unit using only Archeotech weapons.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Harvester:</strong> Complete three Agendas related to Collecting Location Data.</li>
        </ul>
