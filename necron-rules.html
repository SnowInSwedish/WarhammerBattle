        <!-- Awakening a Tomb World Section -->
        <h2 id="awakening-tomb-world" class="section-title">Awakening a Tomb World</h2>
        <p>A Necron tomb world’s awakening is a multi-stage process, empowering its systems and giving access to Master System abilities. Your Necron Crusade force will distribute power to these systems, gaining bonuses for battles.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Awakening Points</h3>
        <p>Your Crusade force starts with 3 Awakening Points to allocate across three Systems: Command, Reanimation, and Translocation. The total distribution of these points will unlock Master System abilities.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">System Bonuses</h3>
        <p>Each System provides three unique bonuses. You can select a System bonus by completing the relevant Awakening Agenda and allocating an Awakening Point to it. Bonuses include enhancements to durability, reanimation abilities, or increased mobility.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Awakening Agendas</h3>
        <p>To allocate an Awakening Point, you must complete an Awakening Agenda. These are specialized objectives tied to each system. Completing an Agenda lets you choose a System bonus and allocate an Awakening Point to it.</p>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Master Systems</h3>
        <p>Once all three Awakening Points are allocated, you unlock Master System abilities. Using these powerful abilities requires you to roll a D3 and remove that many Awakening Points, reducing your access to system bonuses.</p>

        <!-- Dyastic Systems Breakdown -->
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Dyastic Awakening Systems</h3>
        <h4>Command System</h4>
        <p>The Command System strengthens your control over your Necron army by reinforcing the neural links between your forces and the dynasty's leaders.</p>

        </ul>

        <h4>Reanimation System</h4>
        <p>Focused on enhancing the reanimation capabilities of Necron forces, the Reanimation System improves their ability to recover from damage.</p>
        <h4>Awakening Agenda: Immortal Servitude</h4>
        <p>Track each wound recovered through Reanimation Protocols. Every 12 wounds gives your Warlord 1XP (max 3XP). Gain 12 wounds to activate a Reanimation System bonus and allocate 1 Awakening Point.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rapid Reanimation:</strong> Reroll a Reanimation Protocols roll once per battle round.</li>
            <li><strong>Resurrection Flux:</strong> Add 1 to Reanimation Protocols rolls for units Below Half-strength.</li>

        <h4>Translocation System</h4>
        <p>The Translocation System enhances Necron mobility by enabling dimensional travel across the battlefield.</p>
